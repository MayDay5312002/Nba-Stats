In this repo, web scraping, with Python web framework Scrapy, is utilized to gather data needed. 
Every hour scraping of the NBA stats site is executed, replacing the current data if different from the scraped data. 
Minimal styling is done.
The goal of this project is to show automated web scraping and making a website based on the scraped data.
